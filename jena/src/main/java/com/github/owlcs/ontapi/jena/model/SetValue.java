 * A technical generic interface to provide a possibility to assign {@link RDFNode} value (so-called filler)

 * A value can be either {@link OntClass}, {@link OntDataRange}, {@link OntIndividual}
 * or {@link org.apache.jena.rdf.model.Literal}, depending on a concrete {@link OntClass} or {@link OntDataRange} type.
 * This interface is used to construct {@link OntClass class expression}s and {@link OntDataRange data range}s as a base.
